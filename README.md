This repo contains an optimiser for the idle game Farmer Against Potatoes Idle.

Within the game there are "pets" that you can equip to give a boost. There are 104 different pets, with various bonuses. In total there are 23 possible bonuses the pets can give, with some pets providing multiple bonuses.

The goal of this project is to use Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to allow more informed decision making in the selection of pets to equip.

The raw data (at data/raw_data.json) was obtained from https://github.com/erik434/fapi-pets/tree/main.
